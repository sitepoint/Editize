<h1>The Editize&#8482; API for ASP.NET</h1>
  <p> This section of the manual explains in detail how to add an <em>Editize</em> 
    field to a form on an ASP.NET-equipped Web site.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Upgrading?</strong><br>
    For information on updating an existing <em>Editize</em> installation to a new release, <a href="#upgrade">see below</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Before integrating <em>Editize </em>into your Content Management System (CMS), 
    you should first install it on your Web server and try out one or more of 
    the sample scripts. Once you have verified that the samples work, you can 
    proceed to use <em>Editize</em> anywhere you like on your site.</p>
  <h2>Step 1: Put the <em>Editize</em> files on your server</h2>
  <p>Your first step should be to copy or upload the contents of the <code>aspdotnet</code> 
    folder of the <em>Editize </em>distribution to a folder on your Web server. 
    If you use your own computer as a Web server for development purposes, copy 
    the files in the <code>aspdotnet</code> folder to a folder in your Web root.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Example 1: Uploading to your Web Host</strong><br>
      If your Web site is hosted by a Web hosting company, use your FTP program 
      (or whatever method you normally use to place files on your Web site) to 
      create a folder called <code>editize</code> in the root of your site. A 
      file in this directory should be accessible with a URL such as <code>http://www.yoursite.com/editize/filename</code>. 
      Upload all of the files in the <code>aspdotnet</code> folder of the <em>Editize</em> 
      distributon to this new folder on your Website.</p>
    <p><strong>Example 2: Installing on your local test server<br>
      </strong> If you use Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) as a Web 
      server on your Windows computer, the Web root folder is <code>C:\Inetpub\wwwroot</code> 
      by default. If you use Apache, the Web root folder is <code>C:\Apache\htdocs</code> 
      by default. Crate a new folder called <code>editize</code> in your Web root 
      folder. Copy all of the files in the <code>aspdotnet</code> folder of the 
      <em>Editize</em> distribution to this new folder on your Website.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The folder where you place the <em>Editize</em> files on your server must 
    not be password protected. None of these files is a security risk, so you 
    don't need to worry about them being publically accessible.</p>
  <p>Here's a list of the files in the <code>aspdotnet</code> folder with an explanation 
    of what each one does:</p>
  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" id="filelist">
    <tr> 
      <td nowrap><code>editize.jar</code></td>
      <td>The <em>Editize</em> Java library file. This contains the <em>Editize 
        </em>applet.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td nowrap><code>bin/EditizeDotNet.dll</code></td>
      <td>The <em>Editize</em> API for ASP.NET. This .NET assembly contains two 
        ASP.NET Server Controls that will generate the HTML and JavaScript code 
        neccessary to display the <em>Editize</em> applet on almost any browser 
        or operating system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td nowrap><code>kunststoff.jar</code></td>
      <td>The Kunststoff Look &amp; Feel. Improves the look of the <em>Editize 
        </em>user interface dramatically, but adds 43KB of Java files for users' 
        browsers to download the first time they visit your site. If you delete 
        this file, <em>Editize</em> will simply run without any visual enhancements, and 
        will load quicker over slow modem connections.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td nowrap><code>osx.html</code></td>
      <td>A small Web page containing JavaScript that allows <em>Editize</em> 
        to behave like a form field on Internet Explorer for Mac OS X.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td nowrap><code>Default.aspx</code><sup>*</sup></td>
      <td>A sample ASP.NET Web Form written in VB.NET that demonstrates how to 
        create <em>Editize</em> form fields compatible with most browsers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td nowrap><code>Default-csharp.aspx</code><sup>*</sup></td>
      <td>A sample ASP.NET Web Form written in C# that demonstrates how to create 
        <em>Editize</em> form fields compatible with most browsers.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p class="note">* Files marked with an asterix are sample scripts only, and 
    are not required for <em>Editize </em>to function on your server.</p>
  <p>See the next section to discover the meaning of the file called <code>PLACE 
    YOUR LICENSE FILE IN THIS DIRECTORY.TXT</code>.</p>
  <h2>Step 2: Put your <em>Editize</em> license file on your server</h2>
  <p>If you are installing <em>Editize </em>on your own machine for local testing (i.e. the site you are working on will be accessible as <code>http://localhost/...</code> or <code>http://127.0.0.1/...</code>), you do not need a license file and can skip this step.</p>
  <p>In most cases, however, you'll want to deploy <em>Editize</em> on a server that is accessible to other people. To do this, you will require an <em>Editize</em> license file. You can get a free trial license file from the <em><a href="http://www.editize.com/">Editize</a></em><a href="http://www.editize.com/"> Web site</a> (click 'Download' and choose the type of license you need).</p>
  <p>There are three types of <em>Editize</em> licenses. A <strong>hostname license</strong> lets you use <em>Editize</em> on a Web site with a particular hostname (e.g. mysite.com). If your Web site is accessible with more than one hostname, (e.g. admin.mysite.com and mysite.com), you will need a license file for each hostname. The majority of trial licenses we issue are hostname licenses. </p>
  <p>A <strong>domain license</strong> lets you use <em>Editize</em> on all Web sites within a particular domain (e.g. mydomain.com). With a domain license, you don't need additional licenses to use <em>Editize</em> on subdomains (e.g. admin.mydomain.com). When you buy <em>Editize</em>, you'll get a domain license for the domain of your choice. </p>
  <p>A <strong>private network IP license</strong> lets you use <em>Editize</em> on a Web server within a private network. This is useful for Intranets and home networks where servers may not neccessarily have hostnames or even fixed IP addresses. In most cases, <em>Editize</em> customer support will be happy to issue you with a temporary private network IP license for a test server while you are developing a site that will eventually be launched on the Internet with a hostname license.</p>
  <p>In most cases, <em>Editize</em> <a href="http://editize.com/support.php">Customer Support</a> will be happy to issue you with additional licenses if you need them at no extra charge, so long as they are only used to run <em>Editize</em> on a site for which you have already bought a license. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions about licensing <em>Editize</em> for your needs.</p>
  <p>If you have a hostname or domain license, the file will be called <code>editize.<em>hostname</em>.lic</code>. If you have a private network IP license, the file will instead be called <code>editize.lic</code>. In either case, copy or upload the file into the same folder that you created in Step 1 above. There is a file called <code>PLACE YOUR LICENSE FILE IN THIS DIRECTORY.TXT</code> to remind you to do this, which you can delete if you like.</p>
  <h2>Step 3: Create a Web Application for the <em>Editize</em> samples</h2>
  <p>ASP.NET looks for assemblies such as <code>EditizeDotNet.dll</code> in 
    a <code>bin</code> folder in the root of the current Web application. For 
    the <em>Editize</em> sample scripts to be able to find the <em>Editize</em> 
    API for ASP.NET on your server, the folder you created on your site in Step 
    1 must be set as the root of a Web application.</p>
  <p>The following steps will walk you through the process of setting up your 
    new <code>editize</code> folder as the root of a new Web application:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>On the server, open the Windows <em>Control Panel</em>.</li>
    <li>Open the <em>Administrative Tools</em> folder.</li>
    <li>Open the <em>Internet Information Services</em> console.</li>
    <li>Expand the tree on the left to find the Web site that contains your new 
      <code>editize</code> folder under <em>Web Sites</em>. Unless your server 
      hosts multiple sites, it should be called <em>Default Web Site</em>.</li>
    <li>Under <em>Default Website</em>, locate and select the <code>editize</code> 
      folder you created in Step 1 above.</li>
    <li>Right-click the folder and choose <em>Properties</em> from the pop-up 
      menu.</li>
    <li>In the properties window that opens, the <em>Application name</em> field 
      is disabled to indicate that this folder is not the root of a Web application.<br>
      <img src="../images/aspnet-nowebapp.gif" width="461" height="440" hspace="5" vspace="5"></li>
    <li>Click the <em>Create</em> button next to the <em>Application name</em> 
      field to create a new Web application rooted in this folder. The <em>Application 
      name</em> field becomes enabled and the name of the folder becomes the name 
      of the new Web Application.<br>
      <img src="../images/aspnet-webapp.gif" width="461" height="440" hspace="5" vspace="5"></li>
    <li>Click OK. Back in the Internet Information Services console, you should 
      notice that the folder in question now has a special Web Application icon, 
      instead of the plain folder icon it displayed previously.<br>
      <img src="../images/aspnet-webapp2.gif" width="152" height="160" hspace="5" vspace="5"> 
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The <code>editize</code> folder on your server is now the root of a Web Application. 
    Any ASP.NET scripts in this folder (or any of its subfolders) will be able 
    to find the <code>EditizeDotNet.dll</code> file in the <code>bin</code> subfolder 
    of the <code>editize</code> folder.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you later want to use the Editize API for ASP.NET 
    to add Editize fields to Web Forms elsewhere on your Web site, you will have 
    to copy the <code>EditizeDotNet.dll</code> file to the <code>bin</code> directory 
    of the Web Application to which those Web Forms belong.</p>
  <h2>Step 4: Try out a sample script</h2>
  <p>The <em>Editize</em> folder on your server contains a few sample scripts 
    for you to try out. Each of these scripts contains a form with an <em>Editize</em> 
    field in it. When you submit the form, the script should display the HTML 
    document you created in <em>Editize</em>, and allow you to load it back into 
    the original form to edit further.</p>
  <p>Open your Web browser and type the URL to load the <code>Default.aspx</code> 
    script in the <em>Editize</em> folder on your Web server into the address 
    field.</p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><strong>Example 1: Running the sample on your Web Host</strong><br>
      If your Web site is hosted by a Web hosting company, the <em>Editize</em> 
      files should now be in a folder in the root of your Web site (e.g. <code>http://www.yoursite.com/editize/</code>). 
      To load the <code>Default.aspx</code> sample script, type <code>http://www.yoursite.com/editize/Default.aspx</code> 
      into your browser's address field.</p>
    <p> <strong>Example 2: Running the sample on your local test server</strong><br>
      If you've placed the <em>Editize</em> files in a folder on your local test 
      server, you should be able to run the <code>Default.aspx</code> test script 
      by simply typing <code>http://localhost/editize/Default.aspx</code> into 
      your browser's address field.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Have a play with the sample form, submit a document, and then re-open it 
    for editing. If you run into any problems first make sure you've followed 
    the instructions in Step 3 above. If the problem persist, see the <a href="../troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a> 
    section of this manual. Otherwise, you're good to go!</p>
  <h2>Step 5: Integrate <em>Editize</em> into your own Web Forms</h2>
  <p>If you use Visual Studio .NET to build your ASP.NET Web sites, you can skip 
    this section and read <a href="#vsdotnet">Using Editize in Visual Studio .NET</a> 
    instead.</p>
  <p>Add the following code to the top of any ASP.NET page to load the <em>Editize 
    </em>ASP.NET Server Control:</p>
  <p> <code class="tag">&lt;%@ <span class="tagname">Register</span> <span class="attributename">TagPrefix</span>=&quot;SitePoint&quot; 
    <span class="attributename">Namespace</span>=&quot;EditizeDotNet&quot; <span class="attributename">Assembly</span>=&quot;EditizeDotNet&quot; 
    %&gt;</code></p>
  <p>Feel free to use a different <code>TagPrefix</code> value if you like (see 
    the documentation for ASP.NET to learn more about tag prefixes), but the <code>NameSpace</code> 
    value must be <code>&quot;EditizeDotNet&quot;</code> and the <code>Assembly</code> 
    value must match the name of the <code>.dll</code> file you placed in the 
    <code>bin</code> directory (also <code>&quot;EditizeDotNet&quot;</code>) of 
    the page's Web application.</p>
  <p>You can now use the <em>Editize</em> ASP.NET Server Control in any form in 
    this page.</p>
  <h3>Basic Syntax</h3>
  <p>As mentioned above, <em>Editize</em> is designed as a drop-in replacement for 
    the HTML &lt;textarea&gt; tag. We will therefore explain how to use it by 
    comparing it with that tag.</p>
  <p>Here is a typical ASP.NET form containing a &lt;textarea&gt; tag:</p>
  <pre>&lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt;
<span class="tag">  &lt;</span><span class="tagname">textarea</span><span class="tag"> </span><span class="attributename">name</span><span class="tag">=&quot;example&quot;&gt;</span>
  This is the document that the textarea will contain initially.
<span class="tag">  &lt;/</span><span class="tagname">textarea</span><span class="tag">&gt;
</span>  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre>
  <p>The ASP API for <em>Editize</em> is designed so that you can simply replace 
    the <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> tag with an ASP.NET tag to put an <em>Editize</em> 
    field in its place.</p>
  <p>To quickly obtain the code to add an <em>Editize</em> to a form in your Web 
    site, use the <a href="codegen.html">Code Generator</a> to generate it automatically. 
    Alternatively, read on to learn how to write the code yourself.</p>
  <p>Here is an example of the simplest means to invoke <em>Editize</em> as a 
    form field:</p>
  <pre class="tag">&lt;<span class="tagname">form</span> <span class="attributename">method</span>=&quot;post&quot; <span class="attributename">runat</span>=&quot;server&quot;&gt;
  &lt;<span class="tagname">SitePoint:Editize</span> <span class="attributename">runat</span>=&quot;server&quot; <span class="attributename">id</span>=&quot;example&quot;
    <span class="attributename">content</span>=&quot;&amp;lt;p align=&amp;quot;center&amp;quot;&amp;gt;This is the document that Editize will edit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/<span class="tagname">SitePoint:Editize</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span class="tagname">input</span> <span class="attributename">type</span>=&quot;submit&quot; <span class="attributename">value</span>=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/<span class="tagname">form</span>&gt;</pre>
<p>Experienced ASP.NET developers should recognize this immediately. We have used 
  a special tag named <code>&lt;SitePoint:Editize&gt;</code> (where you replace 
  <code>SitePoint</code> with the <code>TagPrefix</code> you specified at the 
  top of the page, if you chose to use something different). This tag is translated 
  by ASP.NET into the HTML and JavaScript code that is neccessary to display an 
  <em>Editize</em> field as part of your form.</p>
<p>The attributes of the tag configure the behavior and appearance of the <em>Editize 
  </em>field. The <code>runat=&quot;server&quot;</code> attribute is required 
  by all ASP.NET Server Controls, so it should always be there. The <code>id=&quot;example&quot;</code> 
  attribute serves to uniquely identify this tag in your page. If you're not terribly 
  familiar with ASP.NET, think of it as the equivalent of the <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> 
  tag's <code>name</code> attribute.</p>
  <p>Finally, the <code>content</code> attribute specifies the initial contents 
    of the field to be displayed when the page is first loaded. As you can see, 
    this is a simple fragment of HTML. Since this value is specified as an attribute, 
    the special HTML characters (<code>&lt; &gt; &quot;</code>) must be translated 
    into their respective HTML character entities (<code>&amp;lt; &amp;gt; &amp;quot;</code>).</p>
  <h3>Configuration Attributes</h3>
  <p>The <em>Editize</em> applet is very configurable. You can customize the formatting 
    applied by the various styles and tools available, and even specify that certain 
    features should be disabled entirely if they are not appropriate for your 
    environment.</p>
  <p>By default, the <em>Editize</em> ASP.NET Server Control enables all of <em>Editize</em>'s 
    formatting tools with default format settings. This section demonstrates how 
    to use the properties supported by the <em>Editize </em>API for ASP.NET to 
    modify these defaults.</p>
  <p>To set the values of properties, simply specify them as you did the other 
    attributes in the simple example above. For instance, to create an <em>Editize</em> 
    field with a base font of 12-pixel Verdana, you would use the following ASP.NET 
    code:</p>
  <pre class="tag">&lt;<span class="tagname">form</span> <span class="attributename">method</span>=&quot;post&quot; <span class="attributename">runat</span>=&quot;server&quot;&gt;
  &lt;<span class="tagname">SitePoint:Editize</span> <span class="attributename">runat</span>=&quot;server&quot; <span class="attributename">id</span>=&quot;example&quot;
    <span class="attributename">basefontface</span>=&quot;Verdana&quot; <span class="attributename">basefontsize</span>=&quot;12&quot;
    <span class="attributename">content</span>=&quot;&amp;lt;p align=&amp;quot;center&amp;quot;&amp;gt;This is the document that Editize will edit.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/<span class="tagname">SitePoint:Editize</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span class="tagname">input</span> <span class="attributename">type</span>=&quot;submit&quot; <span class="attributename">value</span>=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/<span class="tagname">form</span>&gt;</pre>
  <p> A list of all supported properties with examples for each is provided in 
    the <a href="reference.html">Reference</a> section of this manual, or you 
    can use the <a href="codegen.html">Code Generator</a> to select all the properties 
    you want from a list and have the code generated for you automatically.</p>
  <h2>Step 6: (Optional) Providing a List of Images</h2>
  <p>By default, the Insert Image tool in <em>Editize </em>will prompt the user 
    for the URL of the image he or she wishes to insert. Since it can be fairly 
    tedious to hand-type the URL for every image, <em>Editize </em>also provides 
    a method to specify a list of images that users may quickly choose from.</p>
  <p>The <code>ImgListUrl</code> property lets you set a URL from which <em>Editize 
    </em>will download a list of images to present it to the user in the Insert 
    Image dialog. The given URL may refer to a server-side script (e.g. to provide 
    an up-to-date list of images stored in a content management system). If a 
    static list of images is all that you need, you can simply point <em>Editize</em> 
    to a text file of the required format residing on your server.</p>
  <p>The <a href="reference.html#imglisturl">documentation for <code>imglisturl</code></a> 
    in the <a href="reference.html">Reference</a> section of this manual explains 
    the required format of the image list. A sample script written in PHP called 
    <code>imglist.php</code> that produces a list of all the images in a given 
    directory and its subdirectories is provided in the <code>php</code> folder 
    of this distribution</p>
  <h2><a name="vsdotnet"></a>Using Editize in Visual Studio .NET</h2>
  <p>Using ASP.NET Server Controls such as the <em>Editize</em> API for ASP.NET 
    is very easy in Microsoft Visual Studio.NET. All you need to do is add the 
    <em>Editize</em> ASP.NET Server Control (<code>Editize</code>) 
    to your Visual Studio .NET Toolbox, and Visual Studio .NET will take care 
    of almost everything.</p>
  <p>To add the <em>Editize </em>ASP.NET Server Control to your Toolbox, open 
    the Toolbox window if it is not already open and expand the Web Forms section 
    of the Toolbox. Right-click on the background of the Toolbox and select &quot;Customize 
    Toolbox...&quot; from the pop-up menu. In the Customize Toolbox window, select 
    the &quot;.NET Framework Components&quot; tab and click the &quot;Browse...&quot; 
    button. Browse to and select the <code>EditizeDotNet.dll</code> file you received 
    with this distribution (make sure it is given a permanent home, where Visual 
    Studio .NET will be able to find it in future). The <code>Editize</code> and 
    <code>EditizeSubmitButton</code> components will be added to the list of .NET 
    Framework Components. Check only the <code>Editize </code>component (<code>EditizeSubmitButton</code> is included for compatibility with older releases of <em>Editize</em>), and then click OK. You'll 
    now see the <code>Editize</code> component listed in the Toolbox window under Web Forms.</p>
  <p>To add the <em>Editize</em> ASP.NET Server Control to an ASP.NET page in 
    Visual Studio, you can now simply double-click on the item in the Toolbox, 
    or drag the item directly to your page. Visual Studio .NET will take care 
    of registering the <code>TagPrefix</code> at the top of the page, copying 
    the <code>EditizeDotNet.dll</code> file into the <code>bin</code> directory 
    of your Web Application, and adding a reference to the library to make Visual 
    Studio .NET's IntelliSense and Properties Window features aware of the control.</p>
  <p>Once you've added an <em>Editize</em> ASP.NET Server Control to an ASP.NET 
    page, you can edit its properties directly in the Properties Window, where 
    all of the properties are listed in appropriate categories and with short 
    descriptions. To assign an event handler to the <code>ContentChanged</code> 
    event supported by the Control (see <a href="reference.html#events">Control 
    Events</a> in the <a href="reference.html">Reference</a> section), all you 
    have to do is double-click on the <em>Editize</em> Control in the page while 
    in Design view; Visual Studio .NET will create the event handler method and 
    will take you to it so that you can write the code for it by hand.</p>
  <p>Please note that, at this time, you must still deploy the <code>editize.jar</code>, 
    <code>kunstsoff.jar</code>, <code>osx.html</code>, and license files on your 
    site manually.</p>
  <h2><a name="upgrade" id="upgrade"></a>Upgrading to a New Version</h2>
  <p>In most cases, all you need to do to upgrade to a new release of <em>Editize</em> is to upload the new versions of <code>editize.jar</code>, <code>editize.js</code>, <code>osx.html</code>, and optionally <code>kunststoff.jar</code> over the old versions already on your server. It is very important that you replace all of these files, as changes made to one in a particular release often rely on changes made to another.</p>
  <p>Occasionally, we add new features to <em>Editize</em>. Very occasionally, we change the way the APIs work. In both of these cases, you may need to make some changes to the page(s) on your site(s) that use Editize to make the new version work the way you expect it to. Always read the <a href="../history.html">Revision History</a> for the new release to find out when such changes are made.</p>
